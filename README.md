Publishing releases to PyPI
===========================

To publish a new version of your app to PyPI, set the `__version__` string in
your package's `__init__.py`, then run:

	# Publish to PyPI
    ./setup.py publish
	# Tag (change 1.0.0 to the version you are publishing!)
	git tag -a v1.0.0 -m 'Version 1.0.0'
	git push --tags
